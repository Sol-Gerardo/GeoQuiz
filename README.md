## GeoQuiz

### Developer: Gerardo Solis

This mobile application, named "GeoQuiz," provides a fun and interactive quiz centered around geography-related questions.

### Features

- **Question Navigation**: Users can navigate through various geography-related questions.
- **Answer Feedback**: Upon selection, users are immediately informed if their answer is correct or incorrect.
- **Progression Saving**: The application saves the user's progression, preserving their current state and data through various stages.

### Objective

The aim of this application is not merely to quiz users on geography but also to demonstrate crucial Android development concepts, such as managing and preserving user state across activity lifecycle events, handling user interaction, and navigating between different UI states.

### Development Concepts Demonstrated

- **Save States**: Utilizing Android's save states to maintain user progress and data throughout the lifecycle of the application.
- **User Interaction**: Managing user inputs and interactions to navigate through questions and verify answers.

### User Interaction

Users can interact with the application through various UI elements:

- Answering the questions by selecting "True" or "False".
- Navigating between different questions.

### Technical Highlights

- **Save and Restore Instance State**: Ensuring a seamless user experience by maintaining state across activity restarts (due to configuration changes, etc.)
- **Handling User Input**: Efficiently managing user interactions and providing immediate feedback regarding their answers.

### Development Environment
Android Studio: The project was developed using Android Studio with Kotlin as the programming language
